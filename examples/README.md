# circuitpyui demos

copy any of these to the listed device and rename as main.py or code.py

circuitpyui requires the `adafruit_display_shapes` and `adafruit_display_text` libraries. there are no other external dependencies.

the `demo.py` app requires `adafruit_imageload`, and the `cp_sprite_sheet.bmp` file in the root (CircuitPlayground friends are &copy; Adafruit; the 1-bit versions are shared here under CC-BY-SA terms).

in addition, depending on your platform, you may need other support libraries; for example, PyPortal requires `adafruit_touchscreen` for touchscreen input.
